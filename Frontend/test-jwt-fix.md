# JWT Filter Fix Test Guide

## Issue Identified
The JWT authentication filter was calling the wrong validation method, causing authentication to fail even though the token was valid.

## Root Cause
In `JwtAuthenticationFilter.java`, line 47 was calling:
```java
jwtService.validateToken(jwt, userDetails.getUsername())
```

But it should be:
```java
jwtService.validateToken(jwt, userDetails)
```

## Fix Applied
1. ✅ Fixed JWT validation method call
2. ✅ Added comprehensive debug logging to JWT filter
3. ✅ Enhanced error tracking

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Restart Backend
```bash
cd Backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Step 2: Check Backend Console
Look for these debug messages when accessing complaints:
- `JWT Filter - Request URI: /api/complaints`
- `JWT Filter - Auth Header: exists`
- `JWT Filter - Extracted username: admin`
- `JWT Filter - Loaded user details for: admin`
- `JWT Filter - User authorities: [ROLE_ADMIN]`
- `JWT Filter - Authentication set successfully for: admin`

### Step 3: Test Frontend
1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to "View All Complaints"
3. Click "Test Authentication" button
4. Should see successful authentication message

### Step 4: Expected Results
- ✅ No more 403 Forbidden errors
- ✅ Complaints page loads properly
- ✅ Backend console shows successful JWT authentication
- ✅ "Test Authentication" shows correct roles

## Debug Information

### Backend Console Logs
The JWT filter will now log:
- Request URI being processed
- Auth header presence
- Username extraction
- User details loading
- Authorities assignment
- Authentication success/failure

### Frontend Console
- API requests should now succeed
- No more 403 errors
- Proper authentication flow

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Backend starts without errors
- [ ] JWT filter debug logs appear in console
- [ ] Authentication succeeds for admin user
- [ ] No 403 Forbidden errors
- [ ] Complaints page loads properly
- [ ] "Test Authentication" works correctly
- [ ] User roles are properly recognized

## If Still Having Issues

1. **Check Backend Console**: Look for JWT filter debug messages
2. **Verify Token**: Ensure token is being sent in Authorization header
3. **Check User Roles**: Verify admin user has ROLE_ADMIN authority
4. **Restart Both**: Restart both backend and frontend if needed
